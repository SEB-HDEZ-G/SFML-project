This project was made using C++ and Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML).
It works as an interface for the visualization of multiple algorithms and data structures.
It includes search algorithms, sorting algorithms, linear and non-linear data structures.

Please note: the project is still being polished and improved in a lot of aspects,
and additional functionalities are being added along with step-by-step visualization for certain algorithms.

A showcase video of the project will also be added soon.
